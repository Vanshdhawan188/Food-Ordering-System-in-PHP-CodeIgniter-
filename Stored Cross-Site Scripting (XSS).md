## Vulnerability Summary

A critical **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability was discovered in the stores section of **Food Ordering System in PHP CodeIgniter**.  
Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript via the `patname` field (POST parameter), which gets persistently stored in the database and executed whenever the page is viewed.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
### Step-by-Step Exploitation

### Login to the Foodinator Admin Panel
Navigate to the login portal and authenticate using valid credentials.

http://localhost/foodienator/admin/login/index

### Inject XSS Payload in Name Field

Go to Store (select any Store) â†’ edit.

Paste the following payload in the "Address" and "Name" input field and click Update:
## <script>alert(1)</script>

### Trigger the Payload

Reload the stored page. Youâ€™ll see a JavaScript alert(1) triggered â€” confirming the stored XSS vulnerability. Also whenever a adminn logins in the dashboard payload will be triggered and if admin navigates through dashboard payloads get's triggered again which confirms the stored Xss.

This also affects the user side as if anyone tries to open Restaurants xss will be reflected:
http://localhost/foodienator/restaurant/index

## ðŸ›‘ Potential Impact

- **Session Hijacking**: Steal user/admin session cookies via `document.cookie`.
- **Phishing**: Inject fake forms to harvest credentials.
- **Defacement**: Alter webpage content, defame the brand.
- **Data Exfiltration**: Steal sensitive data through background requests.
- **Malware Propagation**: Redirect users to malicious domains.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Gain access to higher-privilege accounts by exploiting stored scripts.

## âœ… Mitigation Strategies

### ðŸ”’ Input Sanitization

Sanitize all user inputs on the server side using functions like `htmlspecialchars()` in PHP.

### ðŸ§¹ Output Encoding

Encode output before rendering dynamic content:

```php
echo htmlentities($user_input, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
